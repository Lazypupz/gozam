1. Audio Fingerprinting
The core of Shazam-like applications is the ability to extract unique fingerprints from audio. A fingerprint is a compressed representation of the sound that allows quick searching in a database.

How Shazam Creates Fingerprints
Convert audio to frequency domain (Spectrogram)

The Fourier Transform (via Fast Fourier Transform, FFT) converts time-based signals into frequency-based signals.

This creates a spectrogram that shows frequency peaks over time.

Identify Key Points (Constellation Map)

Shazam doesn't store the whole spectrogram.

Instead, it selects high-energy peaks (landmark points) in frequency vs. time.

These peaks are converted into hashes.

Create Unique Hashes

Each hash is generated using frequency & time difference between peaks.

A hash could look like:

scss
Copy
Edit
(frequency1, frequency2, time_difference) â†’ song_id
These hashes are stored in a database.

2. Matching Algorithm
When a user records audio:

Extract fingerprint of the recording using the same hashing method.

Search the database for similar hashes.

Find the best match based on how many hashes align.

3. Implementing in Go
Key Go Libraries
github.com/mjibson/go-dsp/fft â†’ FFT for frequency analysis.

github.com/faiface/beep â†’ Audio processing.

github.com/gordonklaus/portaudio â†’ Record live audio.

github.com/boltdb/bolt or Redis â†’ Fast hash lookup.

Basic Flow in Code
go
Copy
Edit
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/cmplx"
    "github.com/mjibson/go-dsp/fft"
)

// Example function to extract frequency peaks using FFT
func extractFingerprint(audioSamples []float64) []complex128 {
    return fft.FFTReal(audioSamples) // Get frequency domain
}

func main() {
    // Example input (mocked audio samples)
    audio := []float64{1.0, 0.5, -0.5, -1.0, 0.0, 0.5} 
    fingerprint := extractFingerprint(audio)

    fmt.Println("Extracted Fingerprint:", fingerprint)
}
4. Optimizing Matching
Use LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) for fast lookup.

Implement Hamming distance to measure similarity.

Store fingerprints in a time-indexed structure.
